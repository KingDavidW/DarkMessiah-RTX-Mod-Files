To install, drop into your Dark Messiah Might and Magic Singleplayer folder.

THIS REQUIRES THE MOD LAUNCHER AND ADVANCED SDK TO WORK. Get the latest stable versions off of ModDB, or the wiltOS Github page!

For load order, make sure the SDK is at the top of the list, and put this somewhere below it!
